<p>HTML and Javascript based art program, to be optimized for GPU acceleration. To be hosted through an Electron.js app!</p>

<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>Brash Art Studio was made to allow easy access to a constantly updating, blazing fast art program. Initially started after my go-to program tried to process a 400 megapixel canvas on the CPU, I set out to build an art program that has the features I actually needed and nothing I didn't. By doing this, I could not only have a faster program but a more streamlined interface. Started in mid-2021, regular updates have brought Brash into a somewhat usable state.</p>

<h3>About the Program</h3>
<p>The main focus of Brash Art Studio is providing a super-performant, open-source art program that is easily accessible. Going forward, the main features will be ones common to most art programs, as well as ones requested through the <a href="https://github.com/Gravity10/BrashArtStudio/issues">Github Issues Tab</a>.</p>

<h3>How to Help Out</h3>
<p>As I'm trying to keep this art program as performant as possible, I'm constantly looking for slight improvements to the code. If you have a suggestion, please use the Github Issues Tab to let me know! I'm also trying to implement WebGL and GPU acceleration for this project, so if you're looking to contribute let me know!</p>

<h3>How To Get It</h3>
<p>I'm currently working on an Electron.js solution to make this desktop-accessible. Possible options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constantly updating program files on every program startup, locally storing last used.</li>
<li>Locally storing a version and allowing users to choose to update to the latest build.</li>
<li>Allowing users access to different release points through Github branches</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, I don't have an Electron.js packaged version to distribute, but a live in-browser version can be found <a href="https://https://brash.netlify.app">here</a>. You can also download this repo and follow the Electron.js Quick Start guide (link above) to set up the application</p>
