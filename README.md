<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Brash Art Studio was made to allow easy access to a constantly updating, blazing fast art program. Initially started after my go-to program tried to open a 400 megapixel canvas with the CPU (and froze my laptop for a half-hour), I set out to build an art program that has the features that I actually need and none I don't. By doing this, I could not only have a faster program but a more streamlined and accessible interface. Started in mid-2021, regular updates have brought Brash into a somewhat usable state.</p>

<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>The main focus of Brash Art Studio is providing a super-performant, open-source art program that is easily accessible. Going forward, the main features will be ones common to most art programs, as well as ones requested through the <a href="https://github.com/Gravity10/BrashArtStudio/issues">Github Issues Tab</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Help Out</h2>
<p>As I'm trying to keep this art program as performant as possible, I'm constantly looking for slight improvements to the code. If you have a suggestion, please use the Github Issues Tab to let me know! I'm also trying to implement WebGL and GPU acceleration for this project, so if you can contribute towards that, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>How To Get It</h2>
<p>At the moment, I don't have an Electron.js packaged version to distribute, but a live in-browser version can be found <a href="https://https://brash.netlify.app">here</a>. You can also download this repo and follow the Electron.js Quick Start guide (link above) to set up the application.</p>
