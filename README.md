## BrashArtStudio
#### HTML and Javascript based art program, to be optimized for GPU acceleration. To be hosted through an Electron.js app!

#### About
Brash Art Studio was made to allow easy access to a constantly updating, blazing fast art program. Initially started after my go-to program tried to process a 400 megapixel canvas on the CPU, I set out to build an art program that has the features I actually needed and nothing I didn't. By doing this, I could not only have a faster program but a more streamlined interface. Started in mid-2021, regular updates have brought Brash into a somewhat usable state.

#### How To Get It
I'm currently working on an Electron.js solution to make this desktop-accessible. Possible options are:
<ul>
<li>Constantly updating program files on every load.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
