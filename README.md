<h2>Brash Art Studio</h2>
  
<p><a href="https://brash.netlify.app" target="_blank">Live Site</a> | <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron.js</a>

<p>HTML and Javascript based art program, to be optimized for GPU acceleration. To be hosted through an Electron.js app!</p>

<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>Brash Art Studio was made to allow easy access to a constantly updating, blazing fast art program. Initially started after my go-to program tried to process a 400 megapixel canvas on the CPU, I set out to build an art program that has the features I actually needed and nothing I didn't. By doing this, I could not only have a faster program but a more streamlined interface. Started in mid-2021, regular updates have brought Brash into a somewhat usable state.</p>

<h3>About the Program</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>How to Help Out</h3>
<p>As I'm trying to keep this art program as performant as possible, I'm constantly looking for slight improvements to the code. If you have a suggestion, please use the <a href="https://github.com/Gravity10/BrashArtStudio/issues">Github Issues Tab</a> to let me know!</p>

<h3>How To Get It</h3>
<p>I'm currently working on an Electron.js solution to make this desktop-accessible. Possible options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constantly updating program files on every program startup, locally storing last used.</li>
<li>Locally storing a version and allowing users to choose to update to the latest build.</li>
<li>Allowing users access to different release points through Github branches</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, I don't have an Electron.js packaged version to distribute, but a live in-browser version can be found <a href="https://https://brash.netlify.app">here</a>.</p>
